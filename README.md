# Cygnus

Finally presenting the code browser you've waited for all your life.

You spent 20 years learning vim -- ahem -- a *fraction* of vim.
You can master this tool in about 20 seconds -- just j k gg G H L M. And w.
 Not even an e or b.
Only / to search not even an ? to search back. 

No plugins to distract you, no complex config files, in fact no config files at all. No battling with pathogen, bundle, vundle, vimballs and git submodules. 

And best of all a colorscheme to die for.  Go ahead, just `gem install` this baby and be set for life.
